# Management APIs

Beside the official [DApp API](https://github.com/ethereumproject/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC) interface the go ethereum node has support for additional management API's. These API's are offered using [JSON-RPC](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) and follow the same conventions as used in the DApp API. The go ethereum package comes with a console client which has support for all additional API's.
